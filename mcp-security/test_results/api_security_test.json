          "mechanism": "The code implements the Zod library, a powerful schema declaration and validation library. Its primary validation mechanisms are:\n1.  **Schema Validation:** Defining expected data structures (objects, arrays, primitives) with specific types and constraints.\n2.  **Type Checking:** Rigorously verifying that the input data conforms to the expected JavaScript types (string, number, boolean, object, array, date, bigint, etc.).\n3.  **Format Validation:** Using built-in checks (often regex-based) for common string formats like email, URL, UUID, CUID, ULID, IP address (v4/v6), datetime, date, time, duration, base64, base64url, JWT, and CIDR.\n4.  **Constraint Checking:** Enforcing constraints like minimum/maximum length for strings/arrays, minimum/maximum values for numbers/dates/bigints, specific literal values, enum values, and multiples for numbers.\n5.  **Custom Validation Logic:** Allowing developers to add custom validation rules using `.refine()`, `.superRefine()`, and `.transform()`.\n6.  **Sanitization (Limited):** Offers optional input coercion (e.g., string to number, string to date) via the `coerce` flag and transformations like `.trim()`, `.toLowerCase()`, `.toUpperCase()` as part of the schema definition.",
          "findings": [
            "**Thoroughness:** Zod provides a very thorough and composable way to define and enforce data validation rules. It covers a wide range of types and common formats.",

            "**Format Validation:** Includes a comprehensive set of built-in format validators for strings.",
            "**Extensibility:** The `.refine()`, `.superRefine()`, and `.transform()` methods allow for highly customized and complex validation scenarios.",
            "**Error Reporting:** Generates detailed error messages, including the path to the invalid data, which aids debugging.",
            "**Special Characters:** Handles standard data types and their representations; validation logic (e.g., regex) operates on the data as provided. It doesn't inherently sanitize *for specific output contexts* (like HTML or SQL), which is appropriate for a validation library.",
            "**SQL Injection:** Zod itself does *not* prevent SQL injection. While it can ensure data is of a certain type (e.g., a number or a string matching a pattern), it doesn't sanitize data for safe inclusion in SQL queries. This responsibility lies outside schema validation, typically requiring parameterized queries or proper escaping at the database layer.",
            "**XSS:** Zod does *not* inherently prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It validates the structure and type of data but doesn't automatically sanitize strings to remove potentially malicious HTML or script content. Sanitization for HTML contexts must be done separately before rendering.",
            "**Command Injection:** Zod does *not* prevent command injection. Validating that a string conforms to a certain format (e.g., a filename pattern) doesn't make it safe to use directly in a shell command.",
            "**Missing/Incomplete Validation:** While Zod itself is a robust tool, the overall validation security depends entirely on *how* it is used. Developers can still create schemas that are too permissive or forget to apply validation to certain inputs. The library provides the capability, but doesn't enforce its application everywhere.",
            "**Coercion Risks:** While useful, the `coerce` option can sometimes hide type issues if not used carefully. For example, coercing `\"\"` (empty string) to a number results in `0`, which might not be the intended behavior in all contexts."

            "Inconsistent Error Formats: The custom error classes defined in Python (`message`, `status_code`, `response`) and Node.js (`message`, `meta` for `AgentRPCError`; `message`, augmented `response` details for `AgentRPCAPIError`) have different structures. The serialized format produced by `serialize-error.js` adds further standard properties (`name`, `message`, `stack`, `code`, etc.). The final API response wraps this serialized error in yet another structure (`status`, `resultType`, `result`). This inconsistency can make error handling complex for clients using different SDKs or interacting directly with the API.",

While errors are caught and returned to the client, they don't appear to be logged centrally for monitoring, debugging, or auditing purposes.",
            "Improper HTTP Status Codes: The tests demonstrate that even when an application-level error occurs within the job (`resultType: \"rejection\"`), the API endpoint returns an HTTP 200 OK status code. This deviates from standard RESTful API design principles, where 4xx or 5xx status codes should indicate client-side or server-side errors, respectively. Relying on the response body to determine success/failure complicates client-side logic and breaks standard HTTP monitoring.",

The current approach places the burden of interpreting potentially verbose and technical errors entirely on the client.",

If the 200-with-rejection pattern is a deliberate design choice for an RPC-style API, ensure it is thoroughly documented and clients are aware they *must* inspect the body.",

Ensure stack traces are not part of user-facing error details.",
            "Implement Secure Logging: Ensure that the actual handler code (not shown in tests) implements robust server-side logging for errors, especially unexpected ones. Avoid logging sensitive data (PII, credentials, detailed internal states) in production logs.",

However, it lacks explicit input sanitization, format validation, or escaping within the handler functions.",
          "findings": [
            "Potential SQL Injection: `tableName` and `schemaName` variables are extracted from the request (`variables`) and passed directly to connector methods (`tableExists`, `getTableSchema`) without any apparent sanitization or escaping performed within these handler functions. The security entirely depends on whether the underlying `connector` implementation uses parameterized queries or proper escaping. If not, this is a high-risk SQL injection vulnerability.",
            "Missing Input Sanitization: There is no validation of the *content* or *format* of `tableName` and `schemaName`. Malicious characters (e.g., `'`, `;`, `--`, `*`, `/`) or overly long strings could be passed to the connector methods.",
            "Incomplete Validation: While the code checks if a schema or table *exists* before attempting to retrieve detailed information, it doesn't validate the input *format* itself. Malformed or potentially malicious inputs are still passed to the existence check methods (`connector.getSchemas`, `connector.tableExists`).",

If these utility functions do not properly encode this data before it's included in the final response (e.g., JSON string values, or if the response is rendered as HTML), it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, especially in error scenarios.",
            "Implicit Trust in Connector: The security of these handlers relies heavily and implicitly on the `ConnectorManager` and the specific connector implementation to handle the raw `tableName` and `schemaName` inputs securely. This lack of defense-in-depth within the handler itself is a weakness.",

This is the most effective defense against SQL injection.",
            "Add Input Sanitization/Validation Layer: Before passing `tableName` and `schemaName` to *any* connector method (even existence checks), validate their format. Use an allow-list approach for characters (e.g., permit only alphanumeric characters and underscores) and reject any input that doesn't conform. Sanitize or reject inputs containing known SQL metacharacters or patterns.",
            "Implement Length Checks: Enforce maximum length limits for `tableName` and `schemaName` early in the handler to prevent overly long inputs.",

            "Audit Connector Implementation: Explicitly review and verify the security practices of the `ConnectorManager` and the specific database connectors used, confirming how they handle dynamic inputs in queries.",
            "Consider Centralized Validation Schema: Implement a dedicated validation layer, possibly using a library (like Zod, Joi), to define and enforce schemas for incoming `variables`, ensuring type correctness, format, and constraints before the handler logic begins.",
            "Improve Type Safety: Replace type assertions (`as string`) with more robust type checks or validation where feasible. Avoid using `any` (`_extra`) if possible, or validate its structure and types rigorously if it becomes necessary to use it."

Pydantic models define the expected structure, data types, required fields, and constraints (like `Literal`). A custom base class `JSONParsingModel` adds pre-validation logic (`@field_validator` with `mode='before'`) to attempt parsing JSON strings into complex types (dicts, lists) before Pydantic's main validation runs. Specific models like `RecreateContainerInput` use custom validation logic (`@model_validator`) for cross-field checks.",

Pydantic validates their *type* (string) but not their *content*. Malicious input (e.g., containing shell metacharacters, path traversal sequences) could potentially lead to command injection or unauthorized file access if the downstream Docker SDK/API calls do not handle them with extreme care (e.g., if they were ever interpolated into a shell command instead of passed as arguments).",
            "Missing Content Validation (Special Characters): Fields used as identifiers or metadata (e.g., `name`, `labels`, `environment` keys/values) lack validation for potentially problematic special characters. While the Docker API might handle many cases, relying solely on it can be risky.",

It does not perform sanitization or content/format validation beyond the basic type checking provided by `argparse`.",

            "**Missing Validation (Format/Content):** String arguments like 'token' (for price, pools), 'from_token', 'to_token' (for swap), and 'address' (for contract, contract-sim) are accepted as raw strings without any format validation. There's no check if the token name/ID or contract address conforms to expected patterns (e.g., length, character set, specific prefix/structure for Ergo addresses). Any string is passed through.",

However, if the unvalidated string inputs ('token', 'address') are used insecurely by the imported functions (e.g., `get_token_price_info`, `analyze_smart_contract`) to construct SQL queries, SQL injection vulnerabilities could exist *in those downstream components*.

Key mechanisms include:\n1.  **Format/Syntax Validation:** Used for cell references (`validate_cell_reference`), cell ranges (`parse_cell_range`), and basic formula structure (starts with '=', balanced parentheses via `validate_formula`). Regex is used for extracting cell references within formulas.\n2.  **Existence Check:** Validates if a `sheet_name` exists within the workbook's `sheetnames`.\n3.  **Boundary Checking:** `validate_range_bounds` checks if provided cell coordinates fall within the detected data boundaries (`max_row`, `max_col`) of the worksheet.\n4.  **Denylist Validation:** `validate_formula` checks against a predefined set of potentially `unsafe_funcs` (`INDIRECT`, `HYPERLINK`, etc.).\n5.  **Type Checking:** Uses Python type hints (`str`, `int`, `Optional`, etc.) for static analysis and developer clarity. Limited runtime checking (`isinstance(current_formula, str)`).",

If `filepath` originates from untrusted user input, this could lead to Path Traversal vulnerabilities, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files the application has access to (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`).",
            "**Incomplete Validation (Formula Safety):** The `validate_formula` function provides only basic checks:\n    - The regex `[A-Z]+\\(` for function names is simplistic and might miss valid functions or be bypassed.\n    - The `unsafe_funcs` denylist is small and likely incomplete. Many other Excel functions could potentially be abused (e.g., related to external data, macros if enabled, complex calculations causing denial of service). Denylist approaches are generally less secure than allowlists.\n    - It doesn't parse the formula semantically, only checks basic syntax (parentheses) and blacklisted function names.",

It will not correctly identify references that include sheet names (e.g., `'Sheet2'!A1`), defined names, or structured references (table syntax).",
            "**Potentially Misleading Boundary Check:** `validate_range_bounds` validates against `worksheet.max_row` and `worksheet.max_col`. These represent the bounds of existing data/formatting, not the absolute limits of an Excel sheet (which are much larger). While this might be the intended behavior (checking within data), the error messages could be clearer, and it doesn't prevent referencing valid but currently empty cells far outside the data range.",
            "**Lack of Sanitization:** While format checks exist, there's no explicit sanitization for inputs like `sheet_name`, `cell`, or `formula` content (beyond the basic formula checks). If these values were ever used in different contexts (e.g., constructing file paths, OS commands, database queries - although not done here), this could be risky.",

However, if the return values or error messages (which may include parts of the user-provided `formula`, `cell`, or `sheet_name`) are displayed in a web application without proper output encoding/escaping, it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities downstream.",

Avoid hardcoding credentials or committing key files to version control.",

It should not be directly exposed via an API endpoint without ensuring the caller is authorized (e.g., an administrator or a service). If intended for user-specific lookups, it should typically operate based on the *authenticated user's* context (e.g., from a verified ID token), not an arbitrary identifier provided in the request.",

          "score": 7,
          "mechanism": "The code utilizes **Custom Error Classes** inheriting from the base `Error` class (e.g., `GitHubError`, `GitHubValidationError`, `GitHubResourceNotFoundError`). It also employs **Factory Functions** (`createGitHubError`, `createEnhancedGitHubError`) to centralize the creation and mapping of errors based on conditions like HTTP status codes or underlying error types (e.g., `AbortError`, network errors). This pattern is typically used within `try-catch` blocks or integrated into higher-level error handling middleware (though the middleware/handlers themselves are not shown).",
          "findings": [
            "**Information Disclosure Risk:** The `response` property within `GitHubError` and its subclasses often includes the `message` property, sometimes directly taken from an external API response (`response?.message` in `createGitHubError`) or an internal error (`error.message` in `createEnhancedGitHubError`). If these source messages contain sensitive details (internal paths, stack snippets, detailed operational info), they could be exposed to the client via the `response` property.",
            "**Stack Traces:** The provided code itself does not explicitly expose stack traces in the user-facing `response` property, which is good. However, the standard `Error` object (from which `GitHubError` inherits) contains a `stack` property. Exposure depends on how these errors are ultimately handled and serialized further up the call chain (e.g., in Express middleware).",
            "**Inconsistent Error Formats (Minor):** While the errors generally follow the `GitHubError` structure (`message`, `status`, `response`), the *content* of the `response` object varies (e.g., `{ message }`, `{ message, reset_at }`, `{ message, error_code }`). The generic fallback in `createEnhancedGitHubError` (`{ message: error.message }`) is less structured than specific error types. Also, `createGitHubError` relies heavily on optional chaining (`response?.message`) which might lead to less informative errors if the `response` object structure is unexpected.",
            "**Missing Error Logging:** This module defines error types but does not implement logging. Logging (`console.error`, dedicated logger) should occur where these errors are caught and handled, which is outside the scope of the provided code. The lack of logging *here* is expected, but it's crucial that it exists elsewhere.",
            "**Proper HTTP Status Codes:** The custom error classes and the `createGitHubError` factory correctly assign specific and appropriate HTTP status codes (401, 403, 404, 409, 422, 429, 408, 500), which is good practice for API error handling.",
            "**Lack of Graceful Degradation:** This code defines error *types*. Graceful degradation (e.g., fallback behavior, user notifications) would be implemented in the code that *catches* these specific errors. The detailed error types (like `GitHubRateLimitError` with `resetAt`) *enable* graceful degradation but don't implement it themselves.",
            "**Error Wrapping:** `createEnhancedGitHubError` provides a good pattern for wrapping lower-level errors (network, timeout) into application-specific `GitHubError` types."
          ],
          "recommendations": [
            "**Sanitize Error Messages:** Do not directly propagate raw error messages from internal operations or external APIs into the `response` property sent to the client. Instead, use generic, safe error messages for the client-facing `response` and log the detailed, original error (including stack trace and potentially sensitive messages) internally for debugging.",
            "**Implement Centralized Logging:** Ensure that a robust logging mechanism is implemented where these errors are caught (e.g., in middleware or top-level handlers). Log the full error object, including the specific type (`name`), message, status, potentially the original error (`cause`), and the stack trace for internal use.",
            "**Ensure No Stack Trace Leakage:** Explicitly configure any API framework middleware (e.g., Express error handler) to *not* include stack traces in error responses sent to clients, especially in production environments.",
            "**Standardize Client-Facing Error Structure:** Define a consistent structure for the `response` property that will be sent to the client across all error types. This might involve always including a `code` or `type` field in addition to a sanitized `message`.",
            "**Add Input Validation:** Consider adding checks in factory functions like `createGitHubError` to ensure the `response` parameter has the expected structure before attempting to access properties like `message` or `reset_at`.",
            "**Document Error Responses:** Clearly document the structure and meaning of the different error responses clients can expect from the API."

It lacks validation against potentially malicious characters or structure. If this `table` value is used directly in database query construction (e.g., string interpolation/concatenation like `SELECT * FROM ${input.table}`), it creates a significant SQL injection vulnerability. Standard parameterized queries often cannot parameterize table or column names, making strict input validation critical.",

            "**Ensure Consistent Validation:** Review the validation rules for the `table` field across `GetMetadataSchema` and `GetAnalyticsSchema`. Make them consistent unless the difference is explicitly required and documented. Requiring non-empty (`min(1)`) is generally safer.",

For dynamic table/column names where parameterization isn't possible, the strict input validation recommended above is absolutely critical.",

            "Information Disclosure: The 'Resource not found' error in `requestHandler.ts` includes the requested `uri` directly in the thrown error message, which might be exposed depending on how the SDK handles it.",
            "Stack Traces Exposure: Stack traces are *not* directly exposed in the response payload sent back to the caller (which is good). However, they *are* logged to the console via `console.error(..., error)`, which might be exposed if console logs are insecurely managed.",
            "Inconsistent Error Formats: While errors caught within `handleToolCall` generally conform to the `{ content: [...], isError: true }` structure, errors thrown from `requestHandler.ts` (like 'Resource not found') rely on the SDK's handling, which might result in a different format.",
            "Insufficient Error Logging: Logging relies solely on `console.error`. This lacks structure, context (like request IDs), and is unsuitable for production environments where logs should ideally be aggregated and analyzed centrally. Errors thrown in `requestHandler.ts` are not explicitly logged within that file.",
            "Improper HTTP Status Codes: Cannot be evaluated from the provided code as it doesn't directly handle HTTP responses. The mapping of internal errors (`isError: true` or thrown exceptions) to protocol-level status codes depends entirely on the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server` implementation.",
            "Lack of Graceful Degradation (User Experience): While some resilience exists (e.g., `ensureBrowser` retry, state checks, catching errors instead of crashing), the error messages returned are highly technical and not user-friendly. They don't guide the user on how to potentially resolve the issue.",
            "Potential Resource Leak: Although there are attempts to close the browser on error or disconnect (`resetBrowserState`, specific `playwright_close` handling, checks in `ensureBrowser`), complex error scenarios or unhandled promise rejections could potentially leave browser instances running."

            "Standardize Error Response Format: Define a single, consistent error response structure for all types of errors across the application, regardless of where they originate.",
            "Improve Logging Strategy: Implement structured logging (e.g., using libraries like Winston or Pino). Include contextual information (timestamps, request IDs, user info if applicable, error codes) and the full stack trace in logs. Send logs to a centralized logging system in production.",
            "Mask Internal Details: Avoid exposing internal implementation details like specific function names, library errors (e.g., detailed Playwright messages), or internal URIs (`console://logs`, `screenshot://name`) in error messages returned to the client.",
            "Define Application-Specific Error Codes: Use internal error codes to categorize different error types. This aids in monitoring, alerting, and potentially allows clients to handle specific errors programmatically.",
            "Review SDK Error Handling: Investigate how the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server` handles errors thrown by request handlers to ensure it aligns with security best practices and desired error response formats.",
            "Enhance User Feedback: Provide more informative and actionable error messages to the end-user when appropriate, guiding them towards resolution.",
            "Robust Resource Management: Ensure all error paths correctly clean up resources like browser instances, potentially using `finally` blocks or more robust state management to prevent leaks."

Errors originating from the underlying `RabbitMQConnection` or `RabbitMQAdmin` objects (e.g., connection failures, authentication issues, non-existent queues/exchanges, API errors, permission denied) will propagate up the call stack, presumably to be handled by a higher-level framework or global handler.",

            "**Inconsistent Error Formats:** Since exceptions from different operations (AMQP vs. HTTP Admin API) and different failure reasons (connection vs. not found vs. permission) are not caught and normalized, the calling layer might receive various raw exception types, leading to inconsistent error responses for the client.",
            "**Missing Error Logging:** There is no evidence of logging within these handlers. When an operation fails, the error is not logged, making debugging and monitoring difficult. It's impossible to know *why* an operation failed without inspecting logs from the calling layer or the RabbitMQ server itself.",
            "**Improper HTTP Status Codes (Implicit):** While these handlers don't directly return HTTP responses, their failure to handle specific errors (e.g., 'queue not found' during `handle_get_queue_info`) makes it difficult for the calling layer (e.g., a web API endpoint) to return appropriate HTTP status codes. A 'not found' error might incorrectly result in a generic 500 Internal Server Error instead of a 404 Not Found.",

            "**Ensure Proper Resource Management:** Use `try...finally` blocks or, preferably, context managers (`with` statement) if the `RabbitMQConnection` object supports them, to ensure resources like connections and channels are always closed, even if errors occur.",

While the description suggests a format, the validation only checks if it's a string. This is insufficient and potentially dangerous. If this string is used to construct database queries (SQL or NoSQL) without rigorous parsing and parameterization *after* validation, it creates a significant **SQL/NoSQL injection vulnerability**.",

When an error is caught, a helper function `getErrorMessage` is used to extract a message string from the error object. The handler then returns a specific JSON structure `{ isError: true, content: [...] }` containing a user-facing error message. \n\nA separate file `src/services/error.ts` defines a more sophisticated error handling infrastructure, including a custom `ReplicateError` class, factory functions for specific error types (`createError`), and an `ErrorHandler` utility object with methods for retrying operations (`withRetries`), parsing API errors (`parseAPIError`), and creating structured error reports (`createErrorReport`). However, this infrastructure (especially logging and structured reporting) does not appear to be utilized within the `catch` blocks of the handlers in `handlers.ts`.",

If the underlying client (`ReplicateClient`) or other dependencies throw errors containing sensitive information (e.g., internal paths, database details, stack snippets), this information is passed directly into the `content` returned by the handler, potentially exposing it to the end-user.",
            "**Potential Information Disclosure (Fallback):** The `getErrorMessage` function has a fallback `return String(error)`. If the caught error is not an `instanceof Error`, this could stringify an object containing sensitive details.",
            "**Suspicious Error Check:** The `getErrorMessage` function checks for `instanceof Promise`. Catching a raw Promise object is highly unusual and might indicate an underlying issue with how async operations are handled or awaited elsewhere. The generic message returned might mask the real problem.",
            "**Missing Error Logging:** The `catch` blocks in `handlers.ts` handle the error by formatting a response, but they **do not log the original error** (including stack trace, type, and any context) on the server-side. This severely hinders debugging, monitoring, and auditing.",
            "**Stack Traces:** While stack traces are not *explicitly* added to the response `content`, the direct inclusion of `error.message` and the `String(error)` fallback carry a risk of leaking parts of stack traces if they are included in the error message itself.",

            "**Improper HTTP Status Codes (Inferred):** The handlers return a JSON structure. The code responsible for sending the HTTP response (not shown) would receive this structure. Since all errors return the same `isError: true` flag, it might be difficult for the calling code to set appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request vs. 500 Internal Server Error) without parsing the human-readable error string, which is fragile. The `ReplicateError` infrastructure in `error.ts` provides context that *could* be used for this, but it's not leveraged in the handlers' catch blocks.",

Log the specific details server-side, potentially using a correlation ID to link user reports to logs.",

            "**Insecure OAuth Grant Type:** The primary runtime OAuth mechanism (`AuthManager._get_oauth_token`) exclusively uses the 'password' (ROPC) grant type. This grant type is discouraged by OAuth 2.0 best practices as it handles the user's password directly and increases security risks.",
            "**Lack of Refresh Token Mechanism:** The `AuthManager` does not implement OAuth refresh tokens. The `refresh_token` method simply re-requests a new access token using the original (password) grant, requiring the continuous availability and use of the user's password and client secret.",
            "**Insecure Storage of Secrets:** The setup scripts (`setup_oauth.py`, `setup_auth.py`) store sensitive credentials (Client Secret, User Password, potentially API Key) directly in a plain text `.env` file. This is insecure if the file system permissions are not strictly controlled.",
            "**Sensitive Data via `input()`:** The setup scripts prompt for sensitive credentials like Client Secret and Password using the standard `input()` function, which can expose them in shell history or logs.",
            "**Missing Token Expiration Handling:** The `AuthManager` retrieves an OAuth token but does not appear to check its expiration time before using it. It relies on API calls failing to trigger a refresh (which re-runs the password grant).",

            "**Implement Refresh Tokens:** Modify the `AuthManager` to properly handle OAuth refresh tokens. Request `offline_access` scope if needed, securely store the refresh token, and use it to obtain new access tokens without repeatedly sending user credentials or client secrets.",
            "**Use Secure Secret Management:** Avoid storing secrets in plain text `.env` files. Utilize environment variables injected securely at runtime, or integrate with a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).",

Instead, it defines Tinybird datasources and pipes to process, aggregate, and expose metrics *about* errors that have presumably already been logged elsewhere (into the `mcp_monitoring` table). The mechanism is essentially data aggregation and monitoring of logged errors, leveraging Tinybird's SQL-like processing and materialized views for efficiency. Error handling for the execution of these Tinybird pipes themselves (e.g., syntax errors, connection issues) is managed by the Tinybird platform.",

For example, `ifNull(version, '')` handles potentially missing version information, and checks for multiple capitalizations of error levels (`level in ['error', 'ERROR', 'critical', 'CRITICAL']`, `level = 'ERROR' or level = 'error'`) are used.",

The C# code uses nested `try-catch` blocks within individual message handlers and a top-level handler in `HandleMessage`. The JavaScript code uses `try-catch` for synchronous operations (like JSON parsing, server setup) and within `async` functions, complemented by WebSocket event listeners (`on('error')`) for connection issues and `Promise`-based timeouts for requests.",

This can leak internal implementation details, file paths, or other sensitive information about the Unity environment.",
            "Stack Traces Not Exposed Externally: The code avoids sending full stack traces over the network. While `Debug.LogError` in Unity logs stack traces locally (in the Unity Console), only `ex.Message` is logged explicitly in the code snippets or sent back in the identified risky cases.",

Others send raw `ex.Message` (potential info leak). Crucially, many `catch` blocks (e.g., in `HandleMessage`, `HandleHandshakeAsync`, `HandleTogglePlayModeAsync`, `HandleExecuteCommandAsync`'s main catch) only log the error locally (`Debug.LogError`) without notifying the JavaScript client, leading to silent failures from the client's perspective.",
            "Missing Error Reporting on Critical Failures (C#): The top-level `catch` in `HandleMessage` only logs the error (`Debug.LogError`) and does not send any error notification back to the client if, for example, JSON deserialization fails or an unknown message type causes an issue before reaching a specific handler's catch.",

For instance, the C# `GetCurrentRenderPipeline` helper lacks specific error handling.

            "Improper HTTP Status Codes: Not directly applicable as it's WebSocket. However, the equivalent concept \u2013 using standardized error codes/types in messages sent back to the caller \u2013 is only partially and inconsistently implemented in the C# code.",

          "mechanism": "The code primarily relies on Python's dynamic typing and type hints (for static analysis, not runtime enforcement). It uses dictionary `.get()` methods and a `try-except` block for safe access to potentially missing keys, which acts as a form of implicit validation/error handling. Some basic string manipulation (e.g., `.lower()`, `.split()`) is used for normalization. Schema validation (checking for expected keys with defaults) is performed during the `load` method. Content validation is minimal and mostly occurs during output formatting (`single_table_mschema`) rather than on input (e.g., filtering examples based on length or type).",
          "findings": [
            "Missing Validation: Lack of explicit runtime type checking for most inputs (e.g., `add_table` name, `add_field` parameters, `add_foreign_key` parameters). Type hints are present but don't enforce types at runtime.",
            "Missing Validation: No validation on the format or content of string inputs like table names, field names, comments (e.g., checking for invalid characters, length limits).",
            "Missing Validation: The `field_type` in `add_field` is not validated against a list of known/allowed database types.",
            "Missing Validation: The structure and content of the `fields` dictionary passed to `add_table` are not validated.",
            "Missing Validation: The elements within the `examples` list provided to `add_field` are not validated (e.g., for type consistency with `field_type` or for potentially harmful content).",
            "Missing Validation: Foreign key constraints (e.g., ensuring referenced tables/columns exist) are not validated when added via `add_foreign_key`.",
            "Incomplete Validation: The `load` method checks for the presence of top-level keys ('db_id', 'schema', 'tables', 'foreign_keys') using `.get()` with defaults, but it doesn't validate the types or the internal structure/content of the loaded data (e.g., ensuring 'tables' is a dict, 'foreign_keys' is a list of lists with the correct number of elements, field definitions have required keys). Malformed JSON data could lead to runtime errors later.",
            "Incomplete Validation: The `default` value in `add_field` is unconditionally converted to a string using `f'{default}'`. This might be inappropriate for non-string default values and loses type information.",
            "Potential Path Traversal: The `save` and `load` methods accept a `file_path`. If this path comes from an untrusted source, and the utility functions (`write_json_to_file`, `read_json_file`) do not properly sanitize the path, it could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities, allowing reading/writing files outside the intended directory.",
            "Improper Handling of Special Characters: While not an immediate vulnerability within this class, the `to_mschema` method formats output using characters like `#`, `[`, `]`, `,`, `=`. If table/column names, comments, or examples contain these characters unexpectedly, it might break the structure of the generated MSchema string or cause issues for downstream parsers. The behavior of the external `examples_to_str` function regarding special characters is also unknown.",
            "Lack of Type Checking: Explicit runtime type checks are largely absent throughout the class.",
            "No Direct Injection Vulnerabilities: The code itself does not appear to construct or execute SQL queries, shell commands, or render HTML directly, making SQL Injection, Command Injection, and direct XSS vulnerabilities unlikely *within this specific class*. However, the data managed by this class could potentially be used unsafely by other parts of the system."
