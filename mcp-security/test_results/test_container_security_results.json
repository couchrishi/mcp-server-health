In particular, accesses were permitted\nabove state->allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the\nstack was already \"large enough\", the access was permitted, but\notherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to \"grow the\nstack\". This undesired rejection was happening in two places:\n- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()\n- in check_stack_range_initialized()\nThis patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests\nthat were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were\nchanged to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior\npersists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it\ncan't run unprivileged for other reasons.\n\nThis patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset\nreads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one\nbecause they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack\nusing registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers\nwith fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the\nfunction's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program\nto verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime\nbecause a too small stack had been allocated for it.\n\nEach function tracks the size of the stack it needs in\nbpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by\nupdate_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access()\nwas calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed\npart of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was\nincorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used\ninstead.\n\nThis tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in\ngrow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to\ncheck_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is\nnow simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size.\ncheck_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been\nallocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.\n\nA few tests were changed to also check the stack depth computation. The\none that fails without this patch is verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv.",

            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: flower: Fix chain template offload\n\nWhen a qdisc is deleted from a net device the stack instructs the\nunderlying driver to remove its flow offload callback from the\nassociated filter block using the 'FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND' command. The stack\nthen continues to replay the removal of the filters in the block for\nthis driver by iterating over the chains in the block and invoking the\n'reoffload' operation of the classifier being used. In turn, the\nclassifier in its 'reoffload' operation prepares and emits a\n'FLOW_CLS_DESTROY' command for each filter.\n\nHowever, the stack does not do the same for chain templates and the\nunderlying driver never receives a 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY' command when\na qdisc is deleted. This results in a memory leak [1] which can be\nreproduced using [2].\n\nFix by introducing a 'tmplt_reoffload' operation and have the stack\ninvoke it with the appropriate arguments as part of the replay.\nImplement the operation in the sole classifier that supports chain\ntemplates (flower) by emitting the 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_{CREATE,DESTROY}'\ncommand based on whether a flow offload callback is being bound to a\nfilter block or being unbound from one.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the issue happens since cited commit which\nreordered tcf_block_offload_unbind() before tcf_block_flush_all_chains()\nin __tcf_block_put(). The order cannot be reversed as the filter block\nis expected to be freed after flushing all the chains.\n\n[1]\nunreferenced object 0xffff888107e28800 (size 2048):\n  comm \"tc\", pid 1079, jiffies 4294958525 (age 3074.287s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    b1 a6 7c 11 81 88 ff ff e0 5b b3 10 81 88 ff ff  ..|......[......\n    01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 e0 aa b0 84 ff ff ff ff  ................\n  backtrace:\n    [<ffffffff81c06a68>] __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x1e8/0x320\n    [<ffffffff81ab374e>] __kmalloc+0x4e/0x90\n    [<ffffffff832aec6d>] mlxsw_sp_acl_ruleset_get+0x34d/0x7a0\n    [<ffffffff832bc195>] mlxsw_sp_flower_tmplt_create+0x145/0x180\n    [<ffffffff832b2e1a>] mlxsw_sp_flow_block_cb+0x1ea/0x280\n    [<ffffffff83a10613>] tc_setup_cb_call+0x183/0x340\n    [<ffffffff83a9f85a>] fl_tmplt_create+0x3da/0x4c0\n    [<ffffffff83a22435>] tc_ctl_chain+0xa15/0x1170\n    [<ffffffff838a863c>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x3cc/0xed0\n    [<ffffffff83ac87f0>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x170/0x440\n    [<ffffffff83ac6270>] netlink_unicast+0x540/0x820\n    [<ffffffff83ac6e28>] netlink_sendmsg+0x8d8/0xda0\n    [<ffffffff83793def>] ____sys_sendmsg+0x30f/0xa80\n    [<ffffffff8379d29a>] ___sys_sendmsg+0x13a/0x1e0\n    [<ffffffff8379d50c>] __sys_sendmsg+0x11c/0x1f0\n    [<ffffffff843b9ce0>] do_syscall_64+0x40/0xe0\nunreferenced object 0xffff88816d2c0400 (size 1024):\n  comm \"tc\", pid 1079, jiffies 4294958525 (age 3074.287s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 57 f6 38 be 00 00 00 00  @.......W.8.....\n    10 04 2c 6d 81 88 ff ff 10 04 2c 6d 81 88 ff ff  ..,m......,m....\n  backtrace:\n    [<ffffffff81c06a68>] __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x1e8/0x320\n    [<ffffffff81ab36c1>] __kmalloc_node+0x51/0x90\n    [<ffffffff81a8ed96>] kvmalloc_node+0xa6/0x1f0\n    [<ffffffff82827d03>] bucket_table_alloc.isra.0+0x83/0x460\n    [<ffffffff82828d2b>] rhashtable_init+0x43b/0x7c0\n    [<ffffffff832aed48>] mlxsw_sp_acl_ruleset_get+0x428/0x7a0\n    [<ffffffff832bc195>] mlxsw_sp_flower_tmplt_create+0x145/0x180\n    [<ffffffff832b2e1a>] mlxsw_sp_flow_block_cb+0x1ea/0x280\n    [<ffffffff83a10613>] tc_setup_cb_call+0x183/0x340\n    [<ffffffff83a9f85a>] fl_tmplt_create+0x3da/0x4c0\n    [<ffffffff83a22435>] tc_ctl_chain+0xa15/0x1170\n    [<ffffffff838a863c>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x3cc/0xed0\n    [<ffffffff83ac87f0>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x170/0x440\n    [<ffffffff83ac6270>] netlink_unicast+0x540/0x820\n    [<ffffffff83ac6e28>] netlink_sendmsg+0x8d8/0xda0\n    [<ffffffff83793def>] ____sys_sendmsg+0x30f/0xa80\n\n[2]\n # tc qdisc add dev swp1 clsact\n # tc chain add dev swp1 ingress proto ip chain 1 flower dst_ip 0.0.0.0/32\n # tc qdisc del dev\n---truncated---",

Fill_meta_index() is called to allocate (via empty_meta_index())\n   and fill a metadata index.  It however suffers a data read error\n   and aborts, invalidating the newly returned empty metadata index.\n   It does this by setting the inode number of the index to zero,\n   which means unused (zero is not a valid inode number).\n\n2. When fill_meta_index() is subsequently called again on another\n   read operation, locate_meta_index() returns the previous index\n   because it matches the inode number of 0.  Because this index\n   has been returned it is expected to have been filled, and because\n   it hasn't been, an out of bounds access is performed.\n\nThis patch adds a sanity check which checks that the inode number\nis not zero when the inode is created and returns -EINVAL if it is.\n\n[phillip@squashfs.org.uk: whitespace fix]\n  Link: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20240409204723.446925-1-phillip@squashfs.org.uk",

In other words, the Tx buffer data on channel B is corrupted\nwith data from channel A.\n\nThe problem appeared since commit 4409df5866b7 (\"serial: sc16is7xx: change\nEFR lock to operate on each channels\"), which changed the EFR locking to\noperate on each channel instead of chip-wise.\n\nThis commit has introduced a regression, because the EFR lock is used not\nonly to protect the EFR registers access, but also, in a very obscure and\nundocumented way, to protect access to the data buffer, which is shared by\nthe Tx and Rx handlers, but also by each channel of the IC.\n\nFix this regression first by switching to kfifo_out_linear_ptr() in\nsc16is7xx_handle_tx() to eliminate the need for a shared Rx/Tx buffer.\n\nSecondly, replace the chip-wise Rx buffer with a separate Rx buffer for\neach channel.",

            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Prevent tail call between progs attached to different hooks\n\nbpf progs can be attached to kernel functions, and the attached functions\ncan take different parameters or return different return values. If\nprog attached to one kernel function tail calls prog attached to another\nkernel function, the ctx access or return value verification could be\nbypassed.\n\nFor example, if prog1 is attached to func1 which takes only 1 parameter\nand prog2 is attached to func2 which takes two parameters. Since verifier\nassumes the bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed based on func2's\nprototype, verifier allows prog2 to access the second parameter from\nthe bpf ctx passed to it. The problem is that verifier does not prevent\nprog1 from passing its bpf ctx to prog2 via tail call. In this case,\nthe bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed from func1 instead of func2,\nthat is, the assumption for ctx access verification is bypassed.\n\nAnother example, if BPF LSM prog1 is attached to hook file_alloc_security,\nand BPF LSM prog2 is attached to hook bpf_lsm_audit_rule_known. Verifier\nknows the return value rules for these two hooks, e.g. it is legal for\nbpf_lsm_audit_rule_known to return positive number 1, and it is illegal\nfor file_alloc_security to return positive number. So verifier allows\nprog2 to return positive number 1, but does not allow prog1 to return\npositive number. The problem is that verifier does not prevent prog1\nfrom calling prog2 via tail call. In this case, prog2's return value 1\nwill be used as the return value for prog1's hook file_alloc_security.\nThat is, the return value rule is bypassed.\n\nThis patch adds restriction for tail call to prevent such bypasses.",

That led to cxl_test crashing\nwith a use-after-free bug with the following signature:\n\n    cxl_port_attach_region: cxl region3: cxl_host_bridge.0:port3 decoder3.0 add: mem0:decoder7.0 @ 0 next: cxl_switch_uport.0 nr_eps: 1 nr_targets: 1\n    cxl_port_attach_region: cxl region3: cxl_host_bridge.0:port3 decoder3.0 add: mem4:decoder14.0 @ 1 next: cxl_switch_uport.0 nr_eps: 2 nr_targets: 1\n    cxl_port_setup_targets: cxl region3: cxl_switch_uport.0:port6 target[0] = cxl_switch_dport.0 for mem0:decoder7.0 @ 0\n1)  cxl_port_setup_targets: cxl region3: cxl_switch_uport.0:port6 target[1] = cxl_switch_dport.4 for mem4:decoder14.0 @ 1\n    [..]\n    cxld_unregister: cxl decoder14.0:\n    cxl_region_decode_reset: cxl_region region3:\n    mock_decoder_reset: cxl_port port3: decoder3.0 reset\n2)  mock_decoder_reset: cxl_port port3: decoder3.0: out of order reset, expected decoder3.1\n    cxl_endpoint_decoder_release: cxl decoder14.0:\n    [..]\n    cxld_unregister: cxl decoder7.0:\n3)  cxl_region_decode_reset: cxl_region region3:\n    Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0x6b6b6b6b6b6b6bc3: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI\n    [..]\n    RIP: 0010:to_cxl_port+0x8/0x60 [cxl_core]\n    [..]\n    Call Trace:\n     <TASK>\n     cxl_region_decode_reset+0x69/0x190 [cxl_core]\n     cxl_region_detach+0xe8/0x210 [cxl_core]\n     cxl_decoder_kill_region+0x27/0x40 [cxl_core]\n     cxld_unregister+0x5d/0x60 [cxl_core]\n\nAt 1) a region has been established with 2 endpoint decoders (7.0 and\n14.0). Those endpoints share a common switch-decoder in the topology\n(3.0). At teardown, 2), decoder14.0 is the first to be removed and hits\nthe \"out of order reset case\" in the switch decoder. The effect though\nis that region3 cleanup is aborted leaving it in-tact and\nreferencing decoder14.0. At 3) the second attempt to teardown region3\ntrips over the stale decoder14.0 object which has long since been\ndeleted.\n\nThe fix here is to recognize that the CXL specification places no\nmandate on in-order shutdown of switch-decoders, the driver enforces\nin-order allocation, and hardware enforces in-order commit. So, rather\nthan fail and leave objects dangling, always remove them.\n\nIn support of making cxl_region_decode_reset() always succeed,\ncxl_region_invalidate_memregion() failures are turned into warnings.\nCrashing the kernel is ok there since system integrity is at risk if\ncaches cannot be managed around physical address mutation events like\nCXL region destruction.\n\nA new device_for_each_child_reverse_from() is added to cleanup\nport->commit_end after all dependent decoders have been disabled. In\nother words if decoders are allocated 0->1->2 and disabled 1->2->0 then\nport->commit_end only decrements from 2 after 2 has been disabled, and\nit decrements all the way to zero since 1 was disabled previously.",

Finally, pfifo_tail_enqueue() return\n`NET_XMIT_CN` status code.\n\nWeird behaviour:\nIn case we set `sch->limit == 0` and trigger pfifo_tail_enqueue() on a\nscheduler that has no packet, the 'drop a packet' step will do nothing.\nThis means the scheduler's qlen still has value equal 0.\nThen, we continue to enqueue new packet and increase scheduler's qlen by\none. In summary, we can leverage pfifo_tail_enqueue() to increase qlen by\none and return `NET_XMIT_CN` status code.\n\nThe problem is:\nLet's say we have two qdiscs: Qdisc_A and Qdisc_B.\n - Qdisc_A's type must have '->graft()' function to create parent/child relationship.\n   Let's say Qdisc_A's type is `hfsc`. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `hfsc_enqueue`.\n - Qdisc_B's type is pfifo_head_drop. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `pfifo_tail_enqueue`.\n - Qdisc_B is configured to have `sch->limit == 0`.\n - Qdisc_A is configured to route the enqueued's packet to Qdisc_B.\n\nEnqueue packet through Qdisc_A will lead to:\n - hfsc_enqueue(Qdisc_A) -> pfifo_tail_enqueue(Qdisc_B)\n - Qdisc_B->q.qlen += 1\n - pfifo_tail_enqueue() return `NET_XMIT_CN`\n - hfsc_enqueue() check for `NET_XMIT_SUCCESS` and see `NET_XMIT_CN` => hfsc_enqueue() don't increase qlen of Qdisc_A.\n\nThe whole process lead to a situation where Qdisc_A->q.qlen == 0 and Qdisc_B->q.qlen == 1.\nReplace 'hfsc' with other type (for example: 'drr') still lead to the same problem.\nThis violate the design where parent's qlen should equal to the sum of its childrens'qlen.\n\nBug impact: This issue can be used for user->kernel privilege escalation when it is reachable.",

In particular, accesses were permitted\nabove state->allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the\nstack was already \"large enough\", the access was permitted, but\notherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to \"grow the\nstack\". This undesired rejection was happening in two places:\n- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()\n- in check_stack_range_initialized()\nThis patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests\nthat were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were\nchanged to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior\npersists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it\ncan't run unprivileged for other reasons.\n\nThis patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset\nreads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one\nbecause they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack\nusing registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers\nwith fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the\nfunction's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program\nto verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime\nbecause a too small stack had been allocated for it.\n\nEach function tracks the size of the stack it needs in\nbpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by\nupdate_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access()\nwas calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed\npart of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was\nincorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used\ninstead.\n\nThis tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in\ngrow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to\ncheck_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is\nnow simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size.\ncheck_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been\nallocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.\n\nA few tests were changed to also check the stack depth computation. The\none that fails without this patch is verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv.",

            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: flower: Fix chain template offload\n\nWhen a qdisc is deleted from a net device the stack instructs the\nunderlying driver to remove its flow offload callback from the\nassociated filter block using the 'FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND' command. The stack\nthen continues to replay the removal of the filters in the block for\nthis driver by iterating over the chains in the block and invoking the\n'reoffload' operation of the classifier being used. In turn, the\nclassifier in its 'reoffload' operation prepares and emits a\n'FLOW_CLS_DESTROY' command for each filter.\n\nHowever, the stack does not do the same for chain templates and the\nunderlying driver never receives a 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY' command when\na qdisc is deleted. This results in a memory leak [1] which can be\nreproduced using [2].\n\nFix by introducing a 'tmplt_reoffload' operation and have the stack\ninvoke it with the appropriate arguments as part of the replay.\nImplement the operation in the sole classifier that supports chain\ntemplates (flower) by emitting the 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_{CREATE,DESTROY}'\ncommand based on whether a flow offload callback is being bound to a\nfilter block or being unbound from one.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the issue happens since cited commit which\nreordered tcf_block_offload_unbind() before tcf_block_flush_all_chains()\nin __tcf_block_put(). The order cannot be reversed as the filter block\nis expected to be freed after flushing all the chains.\n\n[1]\nunreferenced object 0xffff888107e28800 (size 2048):\n  comm \"tc\", pid 1079, jiffies 4294958525 (age 3074.287s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    b1 a6 7c 11 81 88 ff ff e0 5b b3 10 81 88 ff ff  ..|......[......\n    01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 e0 aa b0 84 ff ff ff ff  ................\n  backtrace:\n    [<ffffffff81c06a68>] __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x1e8/0x320\n    [<ffffffff81ab374e>] __kmalloc+0x4e/0x90\n    [<ffffffff832aec6d>] mlxsw_sp_acl_ruleset_get+0x34d/0x7a0\n    [<ffffffff832bc195>] mlxsw_sp_flower_tmplt_create+0x145/0x180\n    [<ffffffff832b2e1a>] mlxsw_sp_flow_block_cb+0x1ea/0x280\n    [<ffffffff83a10613>] tc_setup_cb_call+0x183/0x340\n    [<ffffffff83a9f85a>] fl_tmplt_create+0x3da/0x4c0\n    [<ffffffff83a22435>] tc_ctl_chain+0xa15/0x1170\n    [<ffffffff838a863c>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x3cc/0xed0\n    [<ffffffff83ac87f0>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x170/0x440\n    [<ffffffff83ac6270>] netlink_unicast+0x540/0x820\n    [<ffffffff83ac6e28>] netlink_sendmsg+0x8d8/0xda0\n    [<ffffffff83793def>] ____sys_sendmsg+0x30f/0xa80\n    [<ffffffff8379d29a>] ___sys_sendmsg+0x13a/0x1e0\n    [<ffffffff8379d50c>] __sys_sendmsg+0x11c/0x1f0\n    [<ffffffff843b9ce0>] do_syscall_64+0x40/0xe0\nunreferenced object 0xffff88816d2c0400 (size 1024):\n  comm \"tc\", pid 1079, jiffies 4294958525 (age 3074.287s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 57 f6 38 be 00 00 00 00  @.......W.8.....\n    10 04 2c 6d 81 88 ff ff 10 04 2c 6d 81 88 ff ff  ..,m......,m....\n  backtrace:\n    [<ffffffff81c06a68>] __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x1e8/0x320\n    [<ffffffff81ab36c1>] __kmalloc_node+0x51/0x90\n    [<ffffffff81a8ed96>] kvmalloc_node+0xa6/0x1f0\n    [<ffffffff82827d03>] bucket_table_alloc.isra.0+0x83/0x460\n    [<ffffffff82828d2b>] rhashtable_init+0x43b/0x7c0\n    [<ffffffff832aed48>] mlxsw_sp_acl_ruleset_get+0x428/0x7a0\n    [<ffffffff832bc195>] mlxsw_sp_flower_tmplt_create+0x145/0x180\n    [<ffffffff832b2e1a>] mlxsw_sp_flow_block_cb+0x1ea/0x280\n    [<ffffffff83a10613>] tc_setup_cb_call+0x183/0x340\n    [<ffffffff83a9f85a>] fl_tmplt_create+0x3da/0x4c0\n    [<ffffffff83a22435>] tc_ctl_chain+0xa15/0x1170\n    [<ffffffff838a863c>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x3cc/0xed0\n    [<ffffffff83ac87f0>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x170/0x440\n    [<ffffffff83ac6270>] netlink_unicast+0x540/0x820\n    [<ffffffff83ac6e28>] netlink_sendmsg+0x8d8/0xda0\n    [<ffffffff83793def>] ____sys_sendmsg+0x30f/0xa80\n\n[2]\n # tc qdisc add dev swp1 clsact\n # tc chain add dev swp1 ingress proto ip chain 1 flower dst_ip 0.0.0.0/32\n # tc qdisc del dev\n---truncated---",

Fill_meta_index() is called to allocate (via empty_meta_index())\n   and fill a metadata index.  It however suffers a data read error\n   and aborts, invalidating the newly returned empty metadata index.\n   It does this by setting the inode number of the index to zero,\n   which means unused (zero is not a valid inode number).\n\n2. When fill_meta_index() is subsequently called again on another\n   read operation, locate_meta_index() returns the previous index\n   because it matches the inode number of 0.  Because this index\n   has been returned it is expected to have been filled, and because\n   it hasn't been, an out of bounds access is performed.\n\nThis patch adds a sanity check which checks that the inode number\nis not zero when the inode is created and returns -EINVAL if it is.\n\n[phillip@squashfs.org.uk: whitespace fix]\n  Link: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20240409204723.446925-1-phillip@squashfs.org.uk",

In other words, the Tx buffer data on channel B is corrupted\nwith data from channel A.\n\nThe problem appeared since commit 4409df5866b7 (\"serial: sc16is7xx: change\nEFR lock to operate on each channels\"), which changed the EFR locking to\noperate on each channel instead of chip-wise.\n\nThis commit has introduced a regression, because the EFR lock is used not\nonly to protect the EFR registers access, but also, in a very obscure and\nundocumented way, to protect access to the data buffer, which is shared by\nthe Tx and Rx handlers, but also by each channel of the IC.\n\nFix this regression first by switching to kfifo_out_linear_ptr() in\nsc16is7xx_handle_tx() to eliminate the need for a shared Rx/Tx buffer.\n\nSecondly, replace the chip-wise Rx buffer with a separate Rx buffer for\neach channel.",

            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Prevent tail call between progs attached to different hooks\n\nbpf progs can be attached to kernel functions, and the attached functions\ncan take different parameters or return different return values. If\nprog attached to one kernel function tail calls prog attached to another\nkernel function, the ctx access or return value verification could be\nbypassed.\n\nFor example, if prog1 is attached to func1 which takes only 1 parameter\nand prog2 is attached to func2 which takes two parameters. Since verifier\nassumes the bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed based on func2's\nprototype, verifier allows prog2 to access the second parameter from\nthe bpf ctx passed to it. The problem is that verifier does not prevent\nprog1 from passing its bpf ctx to prog2 via tail call. In this case,\nthe bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed from func1 instead of func2,\nthat is, the assumption for ctx access verification is bypassed.\n\nAnother example, if BPF LSM prog1 is attached to hook file_alloc_security,\nand BPF LSM prog2 is attached to hook bpf_lsm_audit_rule_known. Verifier\nknows the return value rules for these two hooks, e.g. it is legal for\nbpf_lsm_audit_rule_known to return positive number 1, and it is illegal\nfor file_alloc_security to return positive number. So verifier allows\nprog2 to return positive number 1, but does not allow prog1 to return\npositive number. The problem is that verifier does not prevent prog1\nfrom calling prog2 via tail call. In this case, prog2's return value 1\nwill be used as the return value for prog1's hook file_alloc_security.\nThat is, the return value rule is bypassed.\n\nThis patch adds restriction for tail call to prevent such bypasses.",

That led to cxl_test crashing\nwith a use-after-free bug with the following signature:\n\n    cxl_port_attach_region: cxl region3: cxl_host_bridge.0:port3 decoder3.0 add: mem0:decoder7.0 @ 0 next: cxl_switch_uport.0 nr_eps: 1 nr_targets: 1\n    cxl_port_attach_region: cxl region3: cxl_host_bridge.0:port3 decoder3.0 add: mem4:decoder14.0 @ 1 next: cxl_switch_uport.0 nr_eps: 2 nr_targets: 1\n    cxl_port_setup_targets: cxl region3: cxl_switch_uport.0:port6 target[0] = cxl_switch_dport.0 for mem0:decoder7.0 @ 0\n1)  cxl_port_setup_targets: cxl region3: cxl_switch_uport.0:port6 target[1] = cxl_switch_dport.4 for mem4:decoder14.0 @ 1\n    [..]\n    cxld_unregister: cxl decoder14.0:\n    cxl_region_decode_reset: cxl_region region3:\n    mock_decoder_reset: cxl_port port3: decoder3.0 reset\n2)  mock_decoder_reset: cxl_port port3: decoder3.0: out of order reset, expected decoder3.1\n    cxl_endpoint_decoder_release: cxl decoder14.0:\n    [..]\n    cxld_unregister: cxl decoder7.0:\n3)  cxl_region_decode_reset: cxl_region region3:\n    Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0x6b6b6b6b6b6b6bc3: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI\n    [..]\n    RIP: 0010:to_cxl_port+0x8/0x60 [cxl_core]\n    [..]\n    Call Trace:\n     <TASK>\n     cxl_region_decode_reset+0x69/0x190 [cxl_core]\n     cxl_region_detach+0xe8/0x210 [cxl_core]\n     cxl_decoder_kill_region+0x27/0x40 [cxl_core]\n     cxld_unregister+0x5d/0x60 [cxl_core]\n\nAt 1) a region has been established with 2 endpoint decoders (7.0 and\n14.0). Those endpoints share a common switch-decoder in the topology\n(3.0). At teardown, 2), decoder14.0 is the first to be removed and hits\nthe \"out of order reset case\" in the switch decoder. The effect though\nis that region3 cleanup is aborted leaving it in-tact and\nreferencing decoder14.0. At 3) the second attempt to teardown region3\ntrips over the stale decoder14.0 object which has long since been\ndeleted.\n\nThe fix here is to recognize that the CXL specification places no\nmandate on in-order shutdown of switch-decoders, the driver enforces\nin-order allocation, and hardware enforces in-order commit. So, rather\nthan fail and leave objects dangling, always remove them.\n\nIn support of making cxl_region_decode_reset() always succeed,\ncxl_region_invalidate_memregion() failures are turned into warnings.\nCrashing the kernel is ok there since system integrity is at risk if\ncaches cannot be managed around physical address mutation events like\nCXL region destruction.\n\nA new device_for_each_child_reverse_from() is added to cleanup\nport->commit_end after all dependent decoders have been disabled. In\nother words if decoders are allocated 0->1->2 and disabled 1->2->0 then\nport->commit_end only decrements from 2 after 2 has been disabled, and\nit decrements all the way to zero since 1 was disabled previously.",

Finally, pfifo_tail_enqueue() return\n`NET_XMIT_CN` status code.\n\nWeird behaviour:\nIn case we set `sch->limit == 0` and trigger pfifo_tail_enqueue() on a\nscheduler that has no packet, the 'drop a packet' step will do nothing.\nThis means the scheduler's qlen still has value equal 0.\nThen, we continue to enqueue new packet and increase scheduler's qlen by\none. In summary, we can leverage pfifo_tail_enqueue() to increase qlen by\none and return `NET_XMIT_CN` status code.\n\nThe problem is:\nLet's say we have two qdiscs: Qdisc_A and Qdisc_B.\n - Qdisc_A's type must have '->graft()' function to create parent/child relationship.\n   Let's say Qdisc_A's type is `hfsc`. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `hfsc_enqueue`.\n - Qdisc_B's type is pfifo_head_drop. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `pfifo_tail_enqueue`.\n - Qdisc_B is configured to have `sch->limit == 0`.\n - Qdisc_A is configured to route the enqueued's packet to Qdisc_B.\n\nEnqueue packet through Qdisc_A will lead to:\n - hfsc_enqueue(Qdisc_A) -> pfifo_tail_enqueue(Qdisc_B)\n - Qdisc_B->q.qlen += 1\n - pfifo_tail_enqueue() return `NET_XMIT_CN`\n - hfsc_enqueue() check for `NET_XMIT_SUCCESS` and see `NET_XMIT_CN` => hfsc_enqueue() don't increase qlen of Qdisc_A.\n\nThe whole process lead to a situation where Qdisc_A->q.qlen == 0 and Qdisc_B->q.qlen == 1.\nReplace 'hfsc' with other type (for example: 'drr') still lead to the same problem.\nThis violate the design where parent's qlen should equal to the sum of its childrens'qlen.\n\nBug impact: This issue can be used for user->kernel privilege escalation when it is reachable.",

A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.\n\nUsing a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.\n\nA security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.\n\nDocker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.\n\ndocker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.03, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches.

Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped. This should be used with caution.",

            "description": "Moby is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby, is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in dockerd and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code.\n\nThe overlay network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the u32 iptables extension provided by the xt_u32 kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nTwo iptables rules serve to filter incoming VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted network and discards unencrypted datagrams. The rules are appended to the end of the INPUT filter chain, following any rules that have been previously set by the system administrator. Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been discarded.\n\nThe injection of arbitrary Ethernet frames can enable a Denial of Service attack. A sophisticated attacker may be able to establish a UDP or TCP connection by way of the container\u2019s outbound gateway that would otherwise be blocked by a stateful firewall, or carry out other escalations beyond simple injection by smuggling packets into the overlay network.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3 and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Close the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to incoming traffic at the Internet boundary to prevent all VXLAN packet injection, and/or ensure that the `xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.",

This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=.",

New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits.

While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.",

For example, the path \\??\\c:\\x is equivalent to the more common path c:\\x. Before fix, Clean could convert a rooted path such as \\a\\..\\??\\b into the root local device path \\??\\b. Clean will now convert this to .\\??\\b. Similarly, Join(\\, ??, b) could convert a seemingly innocent sequence of path elements into the root local device path \\??\\b. Join will now convert this to \\.\\??\\b. In addition, with fix, IsAbs now correctly reports paths beginning with \\??\\ as absolute, and VolumeName correctly reports the \\??\\ prefix as a volume name.

In particular, accesses were permitted\nabove state->allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the\nstack was already \"large enough\", the access was permitted, but\notherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to \"grow the\nstack\". This undesired rejection was happening in two places:\n- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()\n- in check_stack_range_initialized()\nThis patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests\nthat were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were\nchanged to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior\npersists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it\ncan't run unprivileged for other reasons.\n\nThis patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset\nreads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one\nbecause they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack\nusing registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers\nwith fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the\nfunction's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program\nto verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime\nbecause a too small stack had been allocated for it.\n\nEach function tracks the size of the stack it needs in\nbpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by\nupdate_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access()\nwas calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed\npart of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was\nincorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used\ninstead.\n\nThis tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in\ngrow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to\ncheck_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is\nnow simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size.\ncheck_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been\nallocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.\n\nA few tests were changed to also check the stack depth computation. The\none that fails without this patch is verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv.",

            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: flower: Fix chain template offload\n\nWhen a qdisc is deleted from a net device the stack instructs the\nunderlying driver to remove its flow offload callback from the\nassociated filter block using the 'FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND' command. The stack\nthen continues to replay the removal of the filters in the block for\nthis driver by iterating over the chains in the block and invoking the\n'reoffload' operation of the classifier being used. In turn, the\nclassifier in its 'reoffload' operation prepares and emits a\n'FLOW_CLS_DESTROY' command for each filter.\n\nHowever, the stack does not do the same for chain templates and the\nunderlying driver never receives a 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY' command when\na qdisc is deleted. This results in a memory leak [1] which can be\nreproduced using [2].\n\nFix by introducing a 'tmplt_reoffload' operation and have the stack\ninvoke it with the appropriate arguments as part of the replay.\nImplement the operation in the sole classifier that supports chain\ntemplates (flower) by emitting the 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_{CREATE,DESTROY}'\ncommand based on whether a flow offload callback is being bound to a\nfilter block or being unbound from one.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the issue happens since cited commit which\nreordered tcf_block_offload_unbind() before tcf_block_flush_all_chains()\nin __tcf_block_put(). The order cannot be reversed as the filter block\nis expected to be freed after flushing all the chains.\n\n[1]\nunreferenced object 0xffff888107e28800 (size 2048):\n  comm \"tc\", pid 1079, jiffies 4294958525 (age 3074.287s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    b1 a6 7c 11 81 88 ff ff e0 5b b3 10 81 88 ff ff  ..|......[......\n    01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 e0 aa b0 84 ff ff ff ff  ................\n  backtrace:\n    [<ffffffff81c06a68>] __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x1e8/0x320\n    [<ffffffff81ab374e>] __kmalloc+0x4e/0x90\n    [<ffffffff832aec6d>] mlxsw_sp_acl_ruleset_get+0x34d/0x7a0\n    [<ffffffff832bc195>] mlxsw_sp_flower_tmplt_create+0x145/0x180\n    [<ffffffff832b2e1a>] mlxsw_sp_flow_block_cb+0x1ea/0x280\n    [<ffffffff83a10613>] tc_setup_cb_call+0x183/0x340\n    [<ffffffff83a9f85a>] fl_tmplt_create+0x3da/0x4c0\n    [<ffffffff83a22435>] tc_ctl_chain+0xa15/0x1170\n    [<ffffffff838a863c>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x3cc/0xed0\n    [<ffffffff83ac87f0>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x170/0x440\n    [<ffffffff83ac6270>] netlink_unicast+0x540/0x820\n    [<ffffffff83ac6e28>] netlink_sendmsg+0x8d8/0xda0\n    [<ffffffff83793def>] ____sys_sendmsg+0x30f/0xa80\n    [<ffffffff8379d29a>] ___sys_sendmsg+0x13a/0x1e0\n    [<ffffffff8379d50c>] __sys_sendmsg+0x11c/0x1f0\n    [<ffffffff843b9ce0>] do_syscall_64+0x40/0xe0\nunreferenced object 0xffff88816d2c0400 (size 1024):\n  comm \"tc\", pid 1079, jiffies 4294958525 (age 3074.287s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 57 f6 38 be 00 00 00 00  @.......W.8.....\n    10 04 2c 6d 81 88 ff ff 10 04 2c 6d 81 88 ff ff  ..,m......,m....\n  backtrace:\n    [<ffffffff81c06a68>] __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x1e8/0x320\n    [<ffffffff81ab36c1>] __kmalloc_node+0x51/0x90\n    [<ffffffff81a8ed96>] kvmalloc_node+0xa6/0x1f0\n    [<ffffffff82827d03>] bucket_table_alloc.isra.0+0x83/0x460\n    [<ffffffff82828d2b>] rhashtable_init+0x43b/0x7c0\n    [<ffffffff832aed48>] mlxsw_sp_acl_ruleset_get+0x428/0x7a0\n    [<ffffffff832bc195>] mlxsw_sp_flower_tmplt_create+0x145/0x180\n    [<ffffffff832b2e1a>] mlxsw_sp_flow_block_cb+0x1ea/0x280\n    [<ffffffff83a10613>] tc_setup_cb_call+0x183/0x340\n    [<ffffffff83a9f85a>] fl_tmplt_create+0x3da/0x4c0\n    [<ffffffff83a22435>] tc_ctl_chain+0xa15/0x1170\n    [<ffffffff838a863c>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x3cc/0xed0\n    [<ffffffff83ac87f0>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x170/0x440\n    [<ffffffff83ac6270>] netlink_unicast+0x540/0x820\n    [<ffffffff83ac6e28>] netlink_sendmsg+0x8d8/0xda0\n    [<ffffffff83793def>] ____sys_sendmsg+0x30f/0xa80\n\n[2]\n # tc qdisc add dev swp1 clsact\n # tc chain add dev swp1 ingress proto ip chain 1 flower dst_ip 0.0.0.0/32\n # tc qdisc del dev\n---truncated---",

Fill_meta_index() is called to allocate (via empty_meta_index())\n   and fill a metadata index.  It however suffers a data read error\n   and aborts, invalidating the newly returned empty metadata index.\n   It does this by setting the inode number of the index to zero,\n   which means unused (zero is not a valid inode number).\n\n2. When fill_meta_index() is subsequently called again on another\n   read operation, locate_meta_index() returns the previous index\n   because it matches the inode number of 0.  Because this index\n   has been returned it is expected to have been filled, and because\n   it hasn't been, an out of bounds access is performed.\n\nThis patch adds a sanity check which checks that the inode number\nis not zero when the inode is created and returns -EINVAL if it is.\n\n[phillip@squashfs.org.uk: whitespace fix]\n  Link: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20240409204723.446925-1-phillip@squashfs.org.uk",

Which means that we have a uaf if hwmon\nsysfs is accessed when drvdata has been released but hwmon hasn't.\n\nThe only way out of this seems to be do get rid of devm_ and release/free\neverything explicitly during device unbind.\n\nv2: Change commit message and other minor code changes\nv3: Cleanup from i915_hwmon_register on error (Armin Wolf)\nv4: Eliminate potential static analyzer warning (Rodrigo)\n    Eliminate fetch_and_zero (Jani)\nv5: Restore previous logic for ddat_gt->hwmon_dev error return (Andi)",

            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Prevent tail call between progs attached to different hooks\n\nbpf progs can be attached to kernel functions, and the attached functions\ncan take different parameters or return different return values. If\nprog attached to one kernel function tail calls prog attached to another\nkernel function, the ctx access or return value verification could be\nbypassed.\n\nFor example, if prog1 is attached to func1 which takes only 1 parameter\nand prog2 is attached to func2 which takes two parameters. Since verifier\nassumes the bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed based on func2's\nprototype, verifier allows prog2 to access the second parameter from\nthe bpf ctx passed to it. The problem is that verifier does not prevent\nprog1 from passing its bpf ctx to prog2 via tail call. In this case,\nthe bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed from func1 instead of func2,\nthat is, the assumption for ctx access verification is bypassed.\n\nAnother example, if BPF LSM prog1 is attached to hook file_alloc_security,\nand BPF LSM prog2 is attached to hook bpf_lsm_audit_rule_known. Verifier\nknows the return value rules for these two hooks, e.g. it is legal for\nbpf_lsm_audit_rule_known to return positive number 1, and it is illegal\nfor file_alloc_security to return positive number. So verifier allows\nprog2 to return positive number 1, but does not allow prog1 to return\npositive number. The problem is that verifier does not prevent prog1\nfrom calling prog2 via tail call. In this case, prog2's return value 1\nwill be used as the return value for prog1's hook file_alloc_security.\nThat is, the return value rule is bypassed.\n\nThis patch adds restriction for tail call to prevent such bypasses.",

At 3) the second attempt to teardown region3\ntrips over the stale decoder14.0 object which has long since been\ndeleted.\n\nThe fix here is to recognize that the CXL specification places no\nmandate on in-order shutdown of switch-decoders, the driver enforces\nin-order allocation, and hardware enforces in-order commit.

Finally, pfifo_tail_enqueue() return\n`NET_XMIT_CN` status code.\n\nWeird behaviour:\nIn case we set `sch->limit == 0` and trigger pfifo_tail_enqueue() on a\nscheduler that has no packet, the 'drop a packet' step will do nothing.\nThis means the scheduler's qlen still has value equal 0.\nThen, we continue to enqueue new packet and increase scheduler's qlen by\none. In summary, we can leverage pfifo_tail_enqueue() to increase qlen by\none and return `NET_XMIT_CN` status code.\n\nThe problem is:\nLet's say we have two qdiscs: Qdisc_A and Qdisc_B.\n - Qdisc_A's type must have '->graft()' function to create parent/child relationship.\n   Let's say Qdisc_A's type is `hfsc`.

In particular, accesses were permitted\nabove state->allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the\nstack was already \"large enough\", the access was permitted, but\notherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to \"grow the\nstack\". This undesired rejection was happening in two places:\n- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()\n- in check_stack_range_initialized()\nThis patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests\nthat were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were\nchanged to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior\npersists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it\ncan't run unprivileged for other reasons.\n\nThis patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset\nreads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one\nbecause they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack\nusing registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers\nwith fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the\nfunction's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program\nto verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime\nbecause a too small stack had been allocated for it.\n\nEach function tracks the size of the stack it needs in\nbpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by\nupdate_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access()\nwas calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed\npart of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was\nincorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used\ninstead.\n\nThis tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in\ngrow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to\ncheck_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is\nnow simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size.\ncheck_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been\nallocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.\n\nA few tests were changed to also check the stack depth computation. The\none that fails without this patch is verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv.",

            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: flower: Fix chain template offload\n\nWhen a qdisc is deleted from a net device the stack instructs the\nunderlying driver to remove its flow offload callback from the\nassociated filter block using the 'FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND' command. The stack\nthen continues to replay the removal of the filters in the block for\nthis driver by iterating over the chains in the block and invoking the\n'reoffload' operation of the classifier being used. In turn, the\nclassifier in its 'reoffload' operation prepares and emits a\n'FLOW_CLS_DESTROY' command for each filter.\n\nHowever, the stack does not do the same for chain templates and the\nunderlying driver never receives a 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY' command when\na qdisc is deleted. This results in a memory leak [1] which can be\nreproduced using [2].\n\nFix by introducing a 'tmplt_reoffload' operation and have the stack\ninvoke it with the appropriate arguments as part of the replay.\nImplement the operation in the sole classifier that supports chain\ntemplates (flower) by emitting the 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_{CREATE,DESTROY}'\ncommand based on whether a flow offload callback is being bound to a\nfilter block or being unbound from one.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the issue happens since cited commit which\nreordered tcf_block_offload_unbind() before tcf_block_flush_all_chains()\nin __tcf_block_put(). The order cannot be reversed as the filter block\nis expected to be freed after flushing all the chains.\n\n[1]\nunreferenced object 0xffff888107e28800 (size 2048):\n  comm \"tc\", pid 1079, jiffies 4294958525 (age 3074.287s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    b1 a6 7c 11 81 88 ff ff e0 5b b3 10 81 88 ff ff  ..|......[......\n    01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 e0 aa b0 84 ff ff ff ff  ................\n  backtrace:\n    [<ffffffff81c06a68>] __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x1e8/0x320\n    [<ffffffff81ab374e>] __kmalloc+0x4e/0x90\n    [<ffffffff832aec6d>] mlxsw_sp_acl_ruleset_get+0x34d/0x7a0\n    [<ffffffff832bc195>] mlxsw_sp_flower_tmplt_create+0x145/0x180\n    [<ffffffff832b2e1a>] mlxsw_sp_flow_block_cb+0x1ea/0x280\n    [<ffffffff83a10613>] tc_setup_cb_call+0x183/0x340\n    [<ffffffff83a9f85a>] fl_tmplt_create+0x3da/0x4c0\n    [<ffffffff83a22435>] tc_ctl_chain+0xa15/0x1170\n    [<ffffffff838a863c>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x3cc/0xed0\n    [<ffffffff83ac87f0>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x170/0x440\n    [<ffffffff83ac6270>] netlink_unicast+0x540/0x820\n    [<ffffffff83ac6e28>] netlink_sendmsg+0x8d8/0xda0\n    [<ffffffff83793def>] ____sys_sendmsg+0x30f/0xa80\n    [<ffffffff8379d29a>] ___sys_sendmsg+0x13a/0x1e0\n    [<ffffffff8379d50c>] __sys_sendmsg+0x11c/0x1f0\n    [<ffffffff843b9ce0>] do_syscall_64+0x40/0xe0\nunreferenced object 0xffff88816d2c0400 (size 1024):\n  comm \"tc\", pid 1079, jiffies 4294958525 (age 3074.287s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 57 f6 38 be 00 00 00 00  @.......W.8.....\n    10 04 2c 6d 81 88 ff ff 10 04 2c 6d 81 88 ff ff  ..,m......,m....\n  backtrace:\n    [<ffffffff81c06a68>] __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x1e8/0x320\n    [<ffffffff81ab36c1>] __kmalloc_node+0x51/0x90\n    [<ffffffff81a8ed96>] kvmalloc_node+0xa6/0x1f0\n    [<ffffffff82827d03>] bucket_table_alloc.isra.0+0x83/0x460\n    [<ffffffff82828d2b>] rhashtable_init+0x43b/0x7c0\n    [<ffffffff832aed48>] mlxsw_sp_acl_ruleset_get+0x428/0x7a0\n    [<ffffffff832bc195>] mlxsw_sp_flower_tmplt_create+0x145/0x180\n    [<ffffffff832b2e1a>] mlxsw_sp_flow_block_cb+0x1ea/0x280\n    [<ffffffff83a10613>] tc_setup_cb_call+0x183/0x340\n    [<ffffffff83a9f85a>] fl_tmplt_create+0x3da/0x4c0\n    [<ffffffff83a22435>] tc_ctl_chain+0xa15/0x1170\n    [<ffffffff838a863c>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x3cc/0xed0\n    [<ffffffff83ac87f0>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x170/0x440\n    [<ffffffff83ac6270>] netlink_unicast+0x540/0x820\n    [<ffffffff83ac6e28>] netlink_sendmsg+0x8d8/0xda0\n    [<ffffffff83793def>] ____sys_sendmsg+0x30f/0xa80\n\n[2]\n # tc qdisc add dev swp1 clsact\n # tc chain add dev swp1 ingress proto ip chain 1 flower dst_ip 0.0.0.0/32\n # tc qdisc del dev\n---truncated---",

Fill_meta_index() is called to allocate (via empty_meta_index())\n   and fill a metadata index.  It however suffers a data read error\n   and aborts, invalidating the newly returned empty metadata index.\n   It does this by setting the inode number of the index to zero,\n   which means unused (zero is not a valid inode number).\n\n2. When fill_meta_index() is subsequently called again on another\n   read operation, locate_meta_index() returns the previous index\n   because it matches the inode number of 0.  Because this index\n   has been returned it is expected to have been filled, and because\n   it hasn't been, an out of bounds access is performed.\n\nThis patch adds a sanity check which checks that the inode number\nis not zero when the inode is created and returns -EINVAL if it is.\n\n[phillip@squashfs.org.uk: whitespace fix]\n  Link: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20240409204723.446925-1-phillip@squashfs.org.uk",

Which means that we have a uaf if hwmon\nsysfs is accessed when drvdata has been released but hwmon hasn't.\n\nThe only way out of this seems to be do get rid of devm_ and release/free\neverything explicitly during device unbind.\n\nv2: Change commit message and other minor code changes\nv3: Cleanup from i915_hwmon_register on error (Armin Wolf)\nv4: Eliminate potential static analyzer warning (Rodrigo)\n    Eliminate fetch_and_zero (Jani)\nv5: Restore previous logic for ddat_gt->hwmon_dev error return (Andi)",

            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Prevent tail call between progs attached to different hooks\n\nbpf progs can be attached to kernel functions, and the attached functions\ncan take different parameters or return different return values. If\nprog attached to one kernel function tail calls prog attached to another\nkernel function, the ctx access or return value verification could be\nbypassed.\n\nFor example, if prog1 is attached to func1 which takes only 1 parameter\nand prog2 is attached to func2 which takes two parameters. Since verifier\nassumes the bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed based on func2's\nprototype, verifier allows prog2 to access the second parameter from\nthe bpf ctx passed to it. The problem is that verifier does not prevent\nprog1 from passing its bpf ctx to prog2 via tail call. In this case,\nthe bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed from func1 instead of func2,\nthat is, the assumption for ctx access verification is bypassed.\n\nAnother example, if BPF LSM prog1 is attached to hook file_alloc_security,\nand BPF LSM prog2 is attached to hook bpf_lsm_audit_rule_known. Verifier\nknows the return value rules for these two hooks, e.g. it is legal for\nbpf_lsm_audit_rule_known to return positive number 1, and it is illegal\nfor file_alloc_security to return positive number. So verifier allows\nprog2 to return positive number 1, but does not allow prog1 to return\npositive number. The problem is that verifier does not prevent prog1\nfrom calling prog2 via tail call. In this case, prog2's return value 1\nwill be used as the return value for prog1's hook file_alloc_security.\nThat is, the return value rule is bypassed.\n\nThis patch adds restriction for tail call to prevent such bypasses.",

At 3) the second attempt to teardown region3\ntrips over the stale decoder14.0 object which has long since been\ndeleted.\n\nThe fix here is to recognize that the CXL specification places no\nmandate on in-order shutdown of switch-decoders, the driver enforces\nin-order allocation, and hardware enforces in-order commit.

Finally, pfifo_tail_enqueue() return\n`NET_XMIT_CN` status code.\n\nWeird behaviour:\nIn case we set `sch->limit == 0` and trigger pfifo_tail_enqueue() on a\nscheduler that has no packet, the 'drop a packet' step will do nothing.\nThis means the scheduler's qlen still has value equal 0.\nThen, we continue to enqueue new packet and increase scheduler's qlen by\none. In summary, we can leverage pfifo_tail_enqueue() to increase qlen by\none and return `NET_XMIT_CN` status code.\n\nThe problem is:\nLet's say we have two qdiscs: Qdisc_A and Qdisc_B.\n - Qdisc_A's type must have '->graft()' function to create parent/child relationship.\n   Let's say Qdisc_A's type is `hfsc`.
